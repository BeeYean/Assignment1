          <h2> Why are you taking Web Development class? What do you hope to get out of it? </h2>
          <p> I am taking Web Development class because I have passion in
            learning new technology, love to program and want to apply this knowledge in
            workplace and working towards getting a job where the company values
            new ideas, technology, innovations and creativity.
          </p>
          <p> I hope to be more hand-on, be able to program in an effective way, and
          able to learn new tips and technics of web developments from others.
          Some day I would to volunteer my time to help others who love to code.

          <h2> Concerns & What do you not know?</h2>
          <p> I have not been programming for the past 10 years. A little rusty
            and need some time to pick up the new language. I do not know anything
            about css, and javascript before I enrolled in this class. I might
            ask a lot of questions, and I hope others can be patience with me.
            By asking questions, I will be able to learn quickly. I am
            learning best by visuals i.e pictures, examples, images etc help me
            understand what the output will be like while I am coding. Maybe this
            is because English is my second language and I am slow in reading.
            I want to master in what I am learning, therefore I hope PCS can
            help achieve this goals, i.e providing me with mentoring, coaching,
            etc.
          </p>
          <p> Learning new languages can be challenging at times. I will
            continue to work with Al, and the TAs if I have questions for what
            I do not know or when I get stuck in coding.

           <h2> Every card has a title </h2>
           <p>This card has a <b>paragraph</b> of <span class="Pretty"> text </span> with a <a href= "http://www.google.com"> link </a>. It also has a <i> second </i> <u> sentence</u> of <strike> text </strike> with a <a href= "http://www.yahoo.com"> link </a>
           </p>
           <p> A card is a simple unit of information. We'll use the &ltarticle&gt tag to represent a card and then style it with CSS. </p>

             <h2>Every card has a width </h2>
             <b>But</b> we <i>never</i> use pixels ("px") to determine the size of a card.

             <p>We use measurements that <em><i><strong> flex,</em></i>
               </strong> like percents(%), or that relate to the size of the content, like <i>root &#34rem&#34</i> units(rem), which relate the size of element to the text size and thus make the card very readable.
             </p>

         <h2>This card has lists</h2>
           <p>lists are everywhere in the web applications. They are used for navigation (a list of links):
             <li><a href= "http://www.w3schools.com/html/">  go here </a></li>
             <li><a href= "http://www.w3schools.com/html/"> go there </a></li>
             <li><a href= "http://www.w3schools.com/html/"> go someplace else </a></li>
           </p>
         <p> Or a way to display sets of things </p>
         <p> My favorite colors </p>
         <ul>
         <li><span style="color: red"> red </span></li>
         <li><span style="color: blue"> blue </span></li>
           <li><span style="color: green"> green </span></li></ul>
         <p> You will use lists a lot.</p>

         <h2>Glossary</h2>
